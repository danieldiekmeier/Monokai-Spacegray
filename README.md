Monokai-Spacegray
=================

A modified version of Monokai for use with the Spacegray Theme for Sublime Text

## Why?

I recently discovered [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray), a "A Hyperminimal UI Theme for Sublime Text". I found it visually pleasing, but couldn't really warm up to the Base 16 color scheme that comes with it.

I wanted my colourful, happy Monokai back, that I had used with the Soda Theme. But the background colors didn't really fit together. So I took all the background-colors from the Base 16-Theme and the rest from Monokai and created this thing here.

## But why?

I just want this to be somewhere I can find it if I ever have to set up Sublime Text again.

## But â€¦ why?
